# Microservice Boilerplate Detailed Domain Modeling

This document provides a comprehensive detailed domain model for the Microservice Boilerplate project. It breaks down the high-level requirements into specific domain entities, their attributes, relationships, and behaviors to ensure a clear understanding of the system's structure and interactions.

## System Context

This boilerplate empowers development teams to launch production-ready, multi-tenant SaaS products in days. It provides a standardized foundation with built-in multi-tenancy, SSO/RBAC authorization, real-time notifications, subscriptions, customization, and admin tools—while excluding domain-specific business logic for maximum reusability.

The boilerplate positions between infrastructure (Cloud/Docker) and domain logic. Developers plug in business logic while the boilerplate manages cross-cutting concerns like auth and observability. The diagram illustrates the ecosystem, full lifecycle from dev to production, and integrations for CI/CD and stakeholders.
