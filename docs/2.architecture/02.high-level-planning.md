# Microservice Boilerplate — High-Level Planning

Provide a concise, actionable implementation plan for the Microservice Boilerplate project that turns the requirements and architecture notes into milestones, deliverables and next steps.

## Project Initialization Checklist

The following steps are the necessary, fundamental actions to initialize the software project repository and developer workflows. Each item includes acceptance criteria (AC).

### 1. Setup foundation codebase

#### 1. Scaffold repository structure and projects.

- [ ] .NET Aspire Orchestrator (control-plane / deployment helper)
- [ ] .NET Blazor SSR Web App for Identity Provider (IdP UI + auth server integration)
- [ ] .NET Microservice Web API (template for all domain services)
- [ ] .NET Database Migrator console app (EF/Db migrations runner)
- [ ] .NET YARP-based Application Gateway (reverse-proxy / routing)
- [ ] Angular Single-Page Application (client shell for public UI)

#### 2. Refactor template code to align with architecture.

- [ ] Building microservice bootstrap and startup flows
- [ ] Restructure Angular project modules and components
- [ ] Cross-cutting concerns and miscellaneous code
- [ ] Backend unit and integration tests using MSTest
- [ ] Frontend unit tests using Vitest testing framework

#### 3. Configure development pipeline and quality gates.

- [ ] GitHub actions workflows to build, test, push docker images
- [ ] Schedule Job to analysis code (CodeQL, Codacy, and SonarQube)
- [ ] GitHub self-host runners to deploy this microservice system
- [ ] E2E test scaffold using Playwright for the SPA and IdP

### 2. Implement Identity Provider and authentication.

#### 1. Setup shared frontend stylesheets and components.

- [ ] Using glup to build and bundle customized bootstrap styles
- [ ] Configure angular and Identity Provider use bundled styles
- [ ] Building basic components according to design system
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipeline to build and use shared stylesheets

#### 2. Implement Identity Provider (IdP) Blazor SSR app.

- [ ] Setup authentication server using OpenIddict.
- [ ] Implement user registration, login, logout flows.
- [ ] Implement Angular application main layout and navigation.
- [ ] Integrate with Angular SPA for authentication (OAuth Flows).

### 3. Implement Authorization at the API Gateway level.

- [ ] Auto-generated code for HttpClient for synchonous calls to microservices.
- [ ] Required authorized user session for protected routes.
- [ ] Request context enrichment with user and tenant info.
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) enforcement.

### 4. Implement Administration Microservice's features.

- [ ] Tenant management (create, update, delete tenants).
- [ ] User, role, permissions management (create, read, update, delete).
- [ ] Edition management (plans, features, limits).
- [ ] Localization management (supported languages, translations).
- [ ] System configuration management (feature flags, settings).

### 5. Implement Notification Microservice's features.

- [ ] Real-time notifications using WebSocket SignalR.
- [ ] Email notification templates and sending (integrate with Resend).
- [ ] In-app notification management (CRUD operations).

### 6. Implement Payment Microservice's features.

- [ ] Billing plans and subscription management.
- [ ] Integrate with PayPal for payment processing.

### 7. Implement additional features.

- [ ] Application gateway rate limiting and throttling.
- [ ] Integrate logging and monitoring to external services.
- [ ] Implement caching strategies for performance optimization.
- [ ] User impersonation feature for admins.
- [ ] Scaling strategies and load testing.
